</h3> <p id="p-1489">We are bombarded by information and statistics every day. But if we cannot distinguish credible information from misleading information, then we are vulnerable to manipulation and making decisions that are not in our best interest. Statistics provides tools for us to evaluate information critically. In this sense, statistics is one of the most important things to know about.</p> <p id="p-1490">Statistics are often presented to add credibility to an argument. To give some examples, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-539"><p id="p-1491">4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.</p></li>
<li id="li-540"><p id="p-1492">Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.</p></li>
<li id="li-541"><p id="p-1493">Condoms are effective 94% of the time.</p></li>
<li id="li-542"><p id="p-1494">People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.</p></li>
<li id="li-543"><p id="p-1495">Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.</p></li>
<li id="li-544"><p id="p-1496">A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.</p></li>
<li id="li-545"><p id="p-1497">People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.</p></li>
<li id="li-546"><p id="p-1498">There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.</p></li>
<li id="li-547"><p id="p-1499">79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</p></li>
</ul> <p id="p-1500">All these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, you have probably heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Data and data-interpretation show up in virtually every facet of contemporary life.</p> <p id="p-1501">Many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading and push you into decisions that you might regret. This chapter will help you learn the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-46"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-1502">To give you an overview, here is a diagram of the steps taken in a poll or other statistical study, and the elements in each step that we will discuss in this chapter. We will use many examples to illustrate the whole process.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-1503">Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The <em class="alert">population</em> could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.</p>
<p id="p-1504">If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College.¬†Or it might be:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-548"><p id="p-1505">All community college students in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-549"><p id="p-1506">All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-550"><p id="p-1507">All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.</p></li>
<li id="li-551"><p id="p-1508">All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.</p></li>
<li id="li-552"><p id="p-1509">And so on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-1510">The intended population is also called the <em class="alert">target population</em>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-1513">A <em class="alert">parameter</em> is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-49"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">4.1.4</span> <span class="title">Sample</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1514">To estimate the parameter, we select a <em class="alert">sample</em>, which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a <em class="alert">representative sample</em>, one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-50"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-1515">To get our <em class="alert">data</em>, we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or <em class="alert">raw data</em>. Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A <em class="alert">statistic</em> is a value (percentage, average, etc.) calculated using data from a sample.</p>

<p id="p-1521">As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term.¬†What population should we study?¬†Every person in the district?¬†Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don‚Äôt register? Registered voters may not vote. What about ‚Äúlikely voters?‚Äù</p>
<p id="p-1522">This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a ‚Äúlikely voter.‚Äù¬†Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.</p>
