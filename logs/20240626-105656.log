INFO    :     * PTX:DEPRECATE: (2023-02-13) the string parameter "commentary" will be removed on, or after, 2024-02-13 (but not yet).  Any "commentary" elements present should be adjusted to have their visibility controlled by version support, specifically by first being placed in a "component", and then controlled by entries of a publisher file.  Then "commentary" elements can be hidden just with version support.  To be visible you will need to use version support AND continue to use the string parameter.  On, or after, 2024-02-13, this warning will become a fatal error. (1 time)

INFO    :     * PTX:DEPRECATE: (2024-02-16) a "commentary" element without a @component attribute is now routinely visible in all conversions.  This is unlikely to be what you want since the same effect can be had with no "commentary" element at all.  This message expands on the warning of 2023-02-13, and you might also be getting messages about the deprecation of the string parameter also named "commentary".   Remove the "commentary" element, or consult the PreTeXt Guide to learn about version support and place the "commentary" element into a component using the attribute of the same name. (1 time)
