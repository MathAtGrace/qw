<p><em class="emphasis">Population</em>: While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.</p> <p><em class="emphasis">Parameter</em>: The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.</p> <p><em class="emphasis">Sample</em>: The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.</p> <p><em class="emphasis">Statistic</em>: The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.</p>
