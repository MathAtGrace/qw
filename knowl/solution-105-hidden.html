<p>The first step is to reduce Johnâ€™s taxes by the full amount of the tax credit.</p> <p><span class="process-math">\(\$4,342.50-\$2,300=\$3,042.50\)</span></p> <p>Next we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.</p> <p><span class="process-math">\(\$3,042.50-\$4,135=-\$1,092.50\)</span></p> <p>John will receive a refund of $1,092.50. Notice that having a negative amount after subtracting credits and withholdings means you will receive a refund, while having a positive amount means you still owe money.</p>
