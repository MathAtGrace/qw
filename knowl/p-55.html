<div class="para">“In all those transactions which relate to worldly… (or)  religious affairs, calculation is of use.  In the science of love, in the science of wealth, in music and in the drama, in the art of cooking, and similarly in medicine and in things like the knowledge of architecture; in prose, in poetics and poetry, in logic and grammar and such other things,...the science of computation is held in high esteem.  In relation to the movements  of the sun and other heavenly bodies, in connection with eclipses and conjunction of the planets...it is utilized.  The number, the diameter, and the  perimeter of islands, oceans, and mountains; the extensive dimensions of the rows of habitations and halls belonging to the inhabitants of the world...all of these are made out by means of computation.”</div>
