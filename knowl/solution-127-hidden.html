<p>If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.</p> <p>These values are found by computing <span class="process-math">\(\$451.32 - \$85.63 = \$365.69\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\$451.32 + \$85.63 = \$536.95\)</span></p> <p>We could also write this as a <em class="alert">confidence interval</em>: ($365.69, $536.95).</p> <p>Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.</p>
