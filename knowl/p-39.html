<div class="para">The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years.  They suggest possible answers to the question of why we should study math.  Most are by famous and influential people.  As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked below, “What reason for studying math does this suggest?”  These quotes are rich and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each. You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we’ve done one as an example. Note the column “Is this a good reason?” Some quotes provide reasons that are partly good and partly bad.</div>
