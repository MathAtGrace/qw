</h4>
<p>Sal, Cal and Val are triplets.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Sal gets a paper route at age 14 and decides to invest $150 each month in a mutual fund which averages a 10% annual return. Sal only makes deposits for 5 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.</p></li>
<li><p>Cal is impressed by Sal's bank account, and gets a job in college at age 19 and dutifully makes deposits of $150 each month into the same mutual fund for 9 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.</p></li>
<li><p>Val partied a lot growing up, but then gets a good job at the age of 27 and diligently makes deposits of $150 each month all the way to retirement at the age of 65.</p></li>
</ul> <p>Answer the following questions:</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How much money did each brother invest?</p></li>
<li><p>How much does each brother have saved for retirement at age 65?</p></li>
<li><p>Put the interest rate of 10% into a cell in your spreadsheet, then redo your formulas for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-sal-cal-val-b.html" title="Item b">ItemÂ b</a> so that they reference this cell.  Try changing the interest rate until Sal and Cal end up with the same amount at age 65.  What is this interest rate?</p></li>
<li><p>What interest rate causes Cal and Val to end up with the same amount at age 65?</p></li>
