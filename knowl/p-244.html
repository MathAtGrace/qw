<div class="para">Jennaâ€™s job requires her to travel. She owns a 2006 Toyota 4Runner, but she also has the option to rent a car for her travel. In either case, her employer will reimburse her the same amount for the mileage driven using the rate set by the Internal Revenue Service. In 2015, that rate was 57.5 cents/mile. In this lesson you will explore the question of whether it would be better for Jenna to drive her own car or to rent a car.</div>
