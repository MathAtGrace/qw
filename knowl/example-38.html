<p><em class="emphasis">“My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.”</em></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-4-1-statistical-process.html#example-38" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
