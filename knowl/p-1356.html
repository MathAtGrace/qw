<li>
<p>Taxable income is not over $83,550, so we'll use the second row</p>
<p>Tax will be $2,055 plus 12% of the excess over $20,550</p>
<p>$78,150 - $20,550 = $57,600 excess</p>
<p>12% of $57,600 = $6,912</p>
<p>$2,055 + $6,912 = $8,967</p>
<p>It's off by $3, because the table is providing an average value based on the range of taxable incomes.  But it's close enough to tell the two are consistent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(12\% \times \$78,150 = \$9,378.\text{,}\)</span> which is about $400 more than their actual taxes due.</p></li>
<li>
<p>$8,970/$78,150 <span class="process-math">\(\approx\)</span> 11.5%</p>
<p>Answer will be basically the same if they use $8,967 as the tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxable income will now be $84,150, so the tax will now be calculated using</p>
<p>$9,615 plus 22% of the amount over $83,550.</p>
<p>$84,150-$83,550 = $800 excess.  22% of $800 = $176</p>
<p>Taxes owed:  $9,615 + $176 = $9,791</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original: $106,900 income - $8,970 taxes = $97,930 take home pay.</p>
<p>After: $112,900 income - $9,791 taxes = $103,109 take home pay.</p>
<p>Even though they were pushed into a new marginal bracket, the bonus still increased their take-home income by $2573.</p>
</li>
