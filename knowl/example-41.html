<li><p>To determine if a two-day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two-day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups took the SAT test.</p></li>
<li><p>A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields that typically produce the same amount of food. The treatment group receives the new plant food and the control group does not. The crop yields would then be compared. By growing the two crops at the same time in similar fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.</p></li>
