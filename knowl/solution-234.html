<div class="para">Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.</div>
