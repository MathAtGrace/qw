<div class="para">In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.</div></li>
</ul>
