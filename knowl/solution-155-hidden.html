<p>Answer will vary. Here is one potential solution.</p> <p>Observational: Survey adults who played sports as a child. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Record the percentage of each personality type.</p> <p>Experimental: Survey adults and ask them if they played sports as children. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted.  Compare the results of adults who played sports as children with the adults who didn’t play sports as children.</p> <p>Which is more practical? The Experimental study would allow you to see if there is a significant difference in the personality types based on if the person played sports or didn’t play sports.</p>
