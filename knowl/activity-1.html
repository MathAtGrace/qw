</h4>
<div class="para">Before you do any detailed time management planning, it’s useful to get a very general feeling of whether or not you’ve potentially overextended yourself when it comes to your time resources. One way to do this is by using the “Rule of 60.”</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<div class="para">Multiply your session-credits by four and your semester-credits by two, and then add these two numbers together.  By session-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of courses that only run for a session (i.e. session A or B)?  By semester-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of classes that run the whole semester.</div>
<div class="para">For example: Your answer should be something like <span class="process-math">\(4 \times (6\text{ credits}) + 2 \times (3\text{ credits}) = 30\text{ hours}\)</span> if you’re currently in two session-length courses and one semester-length course.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">How many hours per week do you work, on average? How many hours per week do you participate in clubs or sports, on average?  Add these hours together.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Add together your answers from parts a, b, and c.</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">A university study found that if this number is 60 or higher, you should NOT be surprised if you find yourself having academic difficulties. If you have a total higher than 60, this study found you are much more likely to struggle in school and become overwhelmed. This seems to be a general “magic number” for most students. It does not guarantee anything, but at least gives you an initial realistic idea of whether or not your schedule is manageable. Keep in mind that if you are taking math and/or science, 60 may be too large and you may have to aim for lower hours since math/science courses typically require more time. So, when you register for classes, take this into account. You’re better off taking fewer credits now and being successful, as opposed to overloading yourself, failing, and slowing down your progress and momentum.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="time.html#activity-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
