<p>Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.</p> <p>From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.</p> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/statistics/3_3/mean_vs_median1.png" class="contained" alt="A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the right.
