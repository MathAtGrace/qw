<div class="para">In this activity you will get a chance to let a computer do most of the math for you.  It will be your job to interpret what is going on.</div> <div class="para">In this figure below, we have sliders to change the original principle of the loan <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">P</code>, the annual percentage rate <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>, the number of years of the loan <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Y</code>, and the property tax <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p_tax</code>.  The blue horizontal line is the amount of each monthly payment needed.  The red line is the amount of each of those payments going toward interest.  Thus, the blue area is the total payments towards principle, and the red area is the total payments towards interest.  The orange area represents escrow payments for property taxes and insurance.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1d0bkp9jh7" id="interactive-1" width="600" height="900"></iframe><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.4.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>If the embedded Desmos page above is too small, you can go to the <a class="external" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1d0bkp9jh7" target="_blank">Desmos page</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.</figcaption></figure>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>Set <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">P</code> equal to $130,000.  What number does the area of the blue region correspond to?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>Try moving the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Y</code> sliders around.  Does the area of the blue region tend to stay the same, get larger, or get smaller as you make these changes?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>Given what you know about how loans work, why would this be the case?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>Suppose you have a budget for $700 a month for a home.  Also suppose that you can get an interest rate of 4%, and that you are looking for a 30 year loan.  Move the Principle <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">P</code> around to find the maximum house price you can afford.  What is it?  For this question, you will get full credit as long as you are close enough.  In order to get full credit, you need to be within $1,000 of the correct answer.  Make sure that you factor in that you will have to make escrow payments.</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>In the situation from the last part, what percentage of your money goes towards interest over the life of the loan?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>Use the same information from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task-mortgage-lab-budget-700.html" title="Task 3.4.3.d">part d</a>, but change the length of the loan to 15 years.  Now what is the maximum house price you can afford?  What now is the percentage of your money going towards interest?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>Given your answer to the task above, how would you explain to someone that a 15-year loan has less than twice the monthly payments of a 30 year loan?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h5>Keeping everything else constant, change the annual percentage rate <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>.  Explain how a rising interest rate could be considered to make all home buyers a little poorer.</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h5>Imagine that you have $4,000 in credit card debt, and you’d like to pay it off in 10 years.  Your credit card company charges 20% on your debt.  How much per month will you have to pay?  (For this problem and problem 7 ignore the escrow payments).</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(j)</span></h5>Given the credit card situation from the last part, how much will you have to pay if you try to pay it off in 5 years?</article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(k)</span></h5>Given your answer to the last two parts, explain to your friend why it is important to pay credit card debt off as soon as possible.</article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-4-loans.html#activity-52" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
