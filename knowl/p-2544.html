<div class="para">Both the mean income and median income for the males in the sample were twice as large as the mean income and median income for the females in the sample. The difference between the mean and median income for the females was slightly larger than the mean and median income for the males, so the distribution of incomes for the females is possibly more skewed than the distribution for the males.</div>
