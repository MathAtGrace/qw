<div class="para">For an election using any of these methods to be fair, each person must have an equal right to vote and an equal ability to exercise that right. The <em class="alert">Voting Rights Act of 1965</em> prohibited any election practice that denies the right to vote based on race, but key portions of the law have been invalidated since then. <em class="alert">Voter suppression</em> continues today in different forms such as purging voter rolls, eliminating polling places and voter identification laws, which can also affect transgender people.</div>
