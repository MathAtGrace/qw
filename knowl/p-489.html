<div class="para">One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. Bonds are an example of this type of investment. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.</div>
