<li>
<p>Argument for categorical: Because it is not clear that the shoe sizes represent a measure, the data can be considered categorical.</p>
<p>Argument for quantitative: Because shoe size is a measurement that corresponds to the length of someone’s foot, it can be treated as quantitative data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The mean shoe size to be 7.2 and the median shoe size to be 7.</p>
<p>The mean shoe size is:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}\amp=\frac{(5⋅4+6⋅4+7⋅6+8⋅6+9⋅5)}{25}\\
\amp=7.2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Since there are 25 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because <span class="process-math">\(\frac{25}{2}=12.5\text{,}\)</span> we know it will be the 13th value in the list. The 13th value is 7, so the median shoe size is 7.</p>
<p>The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)</p>
