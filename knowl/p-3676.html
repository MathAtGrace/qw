<p>Notice, in comparison to Hamilton's method, that although the results were the same, they came about in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Bates County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before King (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule.</p>
