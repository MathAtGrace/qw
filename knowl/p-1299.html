<p>Your <em class="alert">filing status</em> is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><em class="alert">Single:</em> If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="alert">Married Filing Jointly:</em> If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)</p></li>
<li><p><em class="alert">Married Filing Separately:</em> If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="alert">Head of Household (with qualifying person):</em> If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).</p></li>
<li><p><em class="alert">Qualifying Widow/Widower (with dependent child):</em> This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.</p></li>
