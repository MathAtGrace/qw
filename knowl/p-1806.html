<div class="para">You may work on your own or in teams of two or three students.  (Three is the absolute maximum â€“ no exceptions.)  If you work in a team, you will all get the same grade on the project.  You need to handle all team issues (division of labor, work effort, etc.) on your own.  However, if would like to break up your group or vote out a member, I am willing to act as your arbitrator.  If you have questions about this project, you can see me during my office hours.</div>
