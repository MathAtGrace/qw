<div class="para">A woman writes the following question to <em class="emphasis">Ask Marilyn</em>, a newspaper help columnist:<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
</div> <blockquote class="blockquote">Nine members of our family will be renting a vacation property. The total rental fee is $3600 for ten days. People will be staying for a varying number of days. I say the first step in figuring how much each person will owe for his or her share is to divide the fee by nine. My husband says we should start by dividing the fee by ten–the number of days we have the rental. Who is right?</blockquote> <ol class="lower-alpha">
