<p>If you are curious to know how a modified boxplot is made, we will explain it briefly. There is a rule called the <em class="alert">1.5*IQR</em> rule to determine which points are considered outliers. An outlier is a point that is more than 1.5 IQRs away from the middle 50% of the data (the box in the boxplot). We know how to calculate the IQR and then we multiply that by 1.5. We subtract that from Q1 to find the <em class="alert">lower fence</em> and add that value to Q3 to find the <em class="alert">upper fence</em>. Values beyond the fences are considered outliers and are drawn with an X or a star. Then we draw the whiskers of a modified box plot to the furthest data value inside the fence on each side.</p>
