<li><p>Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is "twice" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is "twice" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.</p></li>
<li>
<p>A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, "How would you rate the movie?" with these possible answers:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>It was awful.</p></li>
<li><p>It was just okay.</p></li>
<li><p>I liked it.</p></li>
<li><p>It was great.</p></li>
<li><p>Best movie ever!</p></li>
