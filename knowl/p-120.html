<div class="para">You saw that 1 billion can be written as 1,000,000,000 or represented as <span class="process-math">\(10^9\text{.}\)</span> How would 2 billion be represented?  Since 2 billion is 2 times 1 billion, then 2 billion can be written as <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 10^9\text{.}\)</span>  Writing numbers in this way is called scientific notation.  Scientific notation is used primarily for writing very large numbers and very small numbers.  In this lesson, we will focus on large numbers.</div>
