<p>The World Health Organization (www.who.org) is the part of the United Nations that oversees health issues in the world. The WHO leads numerous studies on tobacco use around the world. In its study on Gender and Tobacco, the organization learned that tobacco use among women is increasing. For example, recent research shows that just as many young girls smoke as young boys. The report is filled with information about percentages of women who smoke, percentages of men who smoke, and the percentage of smokers who start smoking by age 10. The language used to describe this information can be difficult to understand. Pay close attention to the language used to describe a percent at the beginning of this lesson. This will help you to understand new findings in the relationship between tobacco use and gender.</p>
