<li><p>A population grows by 4.5% per year. What is its annual growth factor?</p></li>
<li><p>In 2018, the average annual cost of attending a public college was $<span class="process-math">\(21{,}370\text{,}\)</span> and costs were climbing by 6.5% per year. Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(C(t)\text{,}\)</span> the cost of one year of college <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years after 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute values of <span class="process-math">\(C(t)\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Sketch a graph of <span class="process-math">\(C(t)\)</span> that includes all of your answers above.</p></li>
<li><p>If the percent growth rate continues to remain steady, how much will a year of college cost in 2040?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe carefully the meanings of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> in the formulas for exponential growth.</p></li>
