<div class="para">Webster proposed a method similar to Jefferson’s in 1832. It was adopted by Congress in 1842 but replaced by Hamilton’s method in 1852. It was then adopted again in 1911. The difference is that Webster rounded the quotas to the nearest whole number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that didn’t produce the exact number of representatives, he adjusted the divisor like in Jefferson’s method. (In Jefferson’s case, the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always the case with Webster’s method because some numbers may be rounded up.)</div>
