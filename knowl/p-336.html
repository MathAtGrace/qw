<p>If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=EFFECT</code> which will allow us to compare accounts.
