<p>One very important aspect of effectively managing your time is to set specific short term and long-term goals. You need to know what your goals are on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis if you are going to be able to prioritize how you spend your time.  It is important that you constantly review your goals, evaluate whether or not you are meeting them, and revise them accordingly.  If you don't do this, and if you don't do it with honesty to yourself, you will find it more difficult to make good use of your time and attain your educational goals.</p>
