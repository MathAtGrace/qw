<p>In creating the Legislative Branch of government, it was decided that Congress would be made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Representation for the <em class="alert">Senate</em> would be <em class="alert">equal</em> with two senators per state. To account for the different sizes of the states, the representation in the <em class="alert">House of Representatives</em> would be <em class="alert">proportional</em> to the state's population, but there was a controversy over how to count the population.</p>
