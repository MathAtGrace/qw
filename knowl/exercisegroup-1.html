<div class="para">Imagine you have $20,000 saved as a down payment on a house. You wish to take out a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan at 4% APR (remember that mortgage rates usually assume monthly compounding). If the maximum mortgage payment you can afford is $950 per month, then what is the maximum house price that you can afford?</div></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">10<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Suppose another mortgage lender offers you a fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.95% APR. You have $20,000 saved as a down payment, and you can afford a maximum mortgage payment of $950 per month. You are interested in a certain house for sale, with firm selling price of $200,000.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Find the monthly payment for this house. Can you afford it, under the terms of this lender?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house?  If so, state the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em> number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.</div></li>
