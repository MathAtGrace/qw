<p>Imagine you have $20,000 saved as a down payment on a house. You wish to take out a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan at 4% APR (remember that mortgage rates usually assume monthly compounding). If the maximum mortgage payment you can afford is $950 per month, then what is the maximum house price that you can afford?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">10<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Suppose another mortgage lender offers you a fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.95% APR. You have $20,000 saved as a down payment, and you can afford a maximum mortgage payment of $950 per month. You are interested in a certain house for sale, with firm selling price of $200,000.</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the monthly payment for this house. Can you afford it, under the terms of this lender?</p></li>
<li><p>(Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house?  If so, state the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em> number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.</p></li>

<p>An annuity firm pays 5% APR compounded yearly, and offers an investor the following: Deposit $100,000 with them today, and then starting one year from today, you will receive ten equal annual payments, with zero balance remaining afterward in the account. If an investor accepts their offer, then find the following:</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What will be the payment amount for each of the ten equal payments?</p></li>
<li><p>After ten years, how much interest will the investor have received, and what percentage of the total payment sum will represent interest?</p></li>
</ol></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">12<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>For twelve full years, and into an account that pays 3.5% APR compounded quarterly: Yanhong will either pay $1500 at the end of each calendar quarter, or, deposit a single lump sum that will give the same future value amount.</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If Yanhong chooses the single lump sum option, then how much will Yanhong need to deposit?</p></li>
<li><p>If Yanhong needs to have earned $100,000 in this account at the end of the twelve years, then the quarterly deposit amount will need to be increased. What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be?</p></li>
<li><p>(Challenge): If Yanhong will make quarterly deposits into this account for the twelve years, but also has $8,000 to additionally deposit into this account right away: What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be, so that the total balance after twelve years is $100,000?</p></li>

<p>Assume you take out a 30-year mortgage loan for $250,000 at a fixed 4.5% APR.</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What will be the amount of your monthly payment?</p></li>
<li><p>After the first ten years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?</p></li>
<li><p>After the first twenty years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the amount of the loan balance reduction during the second ten years, was very considerably bigger than the amount of the loan balance reduction during the first ten years. Why does the loan balance decrease at a faster and faster pace, the longer that the loan has been in repayment?</p></li>
