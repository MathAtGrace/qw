<p>In 1920, no new apportionment was done, because Congress couldn't agree on the method to be used. They appointed a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued to use Webster's method in 1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 and is the method of apportionment still used today.</p>
