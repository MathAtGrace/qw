<li><p>Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the <em class="alert">divisor</em>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <em class="alert">quota</em>.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolved the whole number problem as follows:</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the <em class="alert">initial</em> apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.</p>
<p>Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative.</p>
