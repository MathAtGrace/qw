<div class="para">In some states a <em class="alert">closed primary</em> is used, in which only voters of each party can vote for that party’s candidates. In other states, an <em class="alert">open primary</em> is used, where voters can pick the party whose primary they want to vote in. In other states, <em class="alert">caucuses</em> are used, which are meetings of the political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open primaries have the disadvantage of raiding, though, where a voter could vote in their non-preferred party’s primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their preferred party’s candidate.</div>
