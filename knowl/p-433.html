<li><div class="para">Use a spreadsheet to enter 500 in cell A1. Using a formula and a cell-reference: Compute in cell A2, the amount in the account after one month has passed. Then using the fill down feature, continue the pattern for another eleven full months (you should end at cell A13). Format all the cells to show dollar signs. What is the amount in the account after one year?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now continue the pattern in column A of your spreadsheet to extend for a second full year (you should end at cell A25). What is the amount in the account after two years?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the opening deposit and one year later? (Compute using a formula and cell references)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the end of year one, and the end of year two? (Compute using a formula and cell references)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Challenge) The annual percentage growth that you found in part (d) for the second year, should be identical to the annual percentage growth that you found in part (c) for the first year. Can you mathematically explain why this is true? Do you think this pattern of identical overall annual percentage growth would continue, if you extend the pattern for even more years?</div></li>
