<div class="para">“The long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which geometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most difficult demonstrations led me to imagine that all things, to the knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, providing only that we abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another.”</div>
