<p>For simplicity, let's assume all of the employees are married and filing jointly, and all of their taxable incomes fall between $20,551 and $83,550.  Let's also assume that they will take the standard deduction, have no other income, make no adjustments to their taxable income, and give nothing to charity.  These assumptions will be close enough for this company's purposes.</p>
