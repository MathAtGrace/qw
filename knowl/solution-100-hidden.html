<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $9,525. Since their income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Averyâ€™s taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $38,700 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:</p>  <div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
0.10(\$10,275)+0.12(\$41,775-\$10,275)+0.22(\$55,100-\$41,775)\\
\amp=0.10(\$10,275)+0.12(\$31,500)+0.22(\$13,325)\\
\amp=\$1,027.50+\$3,780+\$2,931.50\\
\amp=\$7,739
\end{align*}
</div> <p>Avery would owe $7,739 in taxes. Note that their overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by their taxable income:</p> <p><span class="process-math">\(\frac{\$7,739}{\$55,100}=0.1405\)</span> or about 14%</p>
</div></body>
