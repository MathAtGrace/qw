<p>A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.</p> <p>The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points</p> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/statistics/3_3/mean_vs_median2.png" class="contained" alt="A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the left.
