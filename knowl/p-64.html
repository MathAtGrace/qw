<div class="para">“Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which  stands continually open to our gaze.  But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters triangles, circles, and other geometric figures with out which it is humanly impossible to understand a single  word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.”</div>
