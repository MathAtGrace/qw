<p>The type of equation we looked at for poverty and teen pregnany is a linear equation, or a linear model.  Recall that the graph of a linear equation is a line.  The primary characteristic of a linear equation is that it has a constant rate of change, meaning that each time the input increases by one, the output changes by a fixed amount.  In the example above, if one state as 1 more person per 100 below the poverty line than another state, then we expect the first state to have 1.3733 more pregnancies per 1000 girls 15-17 years old.  This constant rate of change is also called slope.</p>
