<li><p><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=1000*103%*103%</code> which gives $1060.90</p></li>
<li><p><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=1000*(103%)^2</code> gives the same result of $1060.90, because raising 103% to the second power means the same as multiplying 103% by itself two times.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=1000*(103%)^15</code> which gives $1557.97 rounded to the nearest cent</p></li>

<p>Refer to the table at the bottom for part d and part e.</p>
<p>Note the entry in cell B3 here is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">= B2*103%</code> and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.</p>
<p>You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\((103\%)^{23} \lt 2 \lt (103\%)^{24}\text{,}\)</span> the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.</p></li>

Cell B1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $1,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell A1. Cell B3 shows $1,030.00, which is 103% of the $1,000 shown in cell B2. Cell B4 shows $1,060.90, which is 103% of the $1,030.00 shown in cell B3.
