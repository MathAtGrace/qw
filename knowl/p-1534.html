<p>Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.</p>
