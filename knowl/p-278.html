<div class="para">The Mazurskys want to build a chain link fence around the backyard (the fence is already shown in the diagram above). The fence would have two gates on either side of the house. They decide to do the work themselves. They need an inline post at least every 8 feet along the fence, a corner post at each corner, and a corner post on each side of the gates. The cost for the materials is shown below. The total cost will include 9.4% sales tax.</div>
