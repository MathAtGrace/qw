<li><div class="para">Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <em class="alert">quota</em>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don’t forget what the decimals were). This is the <em class="alert">initial</em> apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If you lower it too far, increase it. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor you end up using is called the <em class="alert">modified divisor</em>. This is a trial-and-error process.</div></li>
