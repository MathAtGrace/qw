<p>(Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house?  If so, state the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em> number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-4-loans.html#li-618" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
