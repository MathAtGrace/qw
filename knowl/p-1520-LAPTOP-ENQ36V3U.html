<p>Although Benjamin Franklin famously claimed in 1789 that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, it wasn’t until 1913 that the 16th amendment was ratified, and income tax was legalized. Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A <em class="alert">poll tax</em>, also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.</p>
