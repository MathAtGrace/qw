<p>Alexander Hamilton (1755 - 1804) was raised in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands by a poor family. He was motivated by his low socioeconomic status to work himself into a higher social standing. He eventually came to the colonies and worked himself into circles of wealth and influence. While Hamilton wasn't pro-slavery and considered himself an abolitionist, when choosing between his societal status and moral obligation, he chose the former.</p>
