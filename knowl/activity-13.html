<p>Taxes can be, as you've probably heard, fairly complicated, but for this lesson we are going to focus on a simple case: a couple we'll name Gracie and Lancel.</p> <ul class="disc">
<li><p>Gracie and Lancel are married with no kids, filing jointly.  No one can claim either as a dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>Together, they earned $106,900 of wage income</p></li>
<li><p>They did <em class="emphasis">not</em> earn anything from interest, dividends, distributions, annuities, benefits, capital gains, or anything else.</p></li>
<li><p>They plan to take the standard deduction.</p></li>
<li><p>They contributed more than $600 to their church (According to instructions from the IRS, for a couple filing jointly who take the standard deduction, the maximum amount they can claim is $600).</p></li>
<li><p>They had no qualified business income</p></li>
<li><p>They can claim $2250 in adjustments to income because Gracie is an elementary teacher who can mark $250 for educator expenses and they can claim $2000 because of their payments toward the interest of their student loans.</p></li>
</ul> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Fill out boxes 1-15 the form to find the couple's taxable income <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/1040.jpg" class="contained"></div></p></li>
<li><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:50%;">
<p>Usually tax owed is looked up from a tax table. You would use the first line of the table if the taxable income from line 6  is at least 72,000 but less than 72,050.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write this as a compound inequality, using t to represent the income from line 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Then use the table provided to determine the tax the couple owes.</p></li>
</ol>
