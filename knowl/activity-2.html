</h4>
<p>One very important aspect of effectively managing your time is to set specific short term and long-term goals. You need to know what your goals are on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis if you are going to be able to prioritize how you spend your time.  It is important that you constantly review your goals, evaluate whether or not you are meeting them, and revise them accordingly.  If you don't do this, and if you don't do it with honesty to yourself, you will find it more difficult to make good use of your time and attain your educational goals.</p> <p>Read all of these directions before you make up your weekly schedule.  Then make your schedule on paper or in a spreadsheet</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Record Class Times in appropriate day/hour blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Record Work hours, Clubs and Sports hours, and Commute times.</p></li>
<li><p>Record all Regular Personal Activities such as meals, family duties, volunteer work, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Record any Special Activities you need to do or want to do on a regular basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a Preview Time (5-30 minutes) immediately before each class whenever possible. During the preview time, review all or some of your notes in preparation for the upcoming class. Finish any reading assignments, if necessary.  If you have two or three classes in a row, preview from last to first class. Use a P to indicate Preview. For example: P Math might mean you preview for your math class; P Math/English means you are previewing two back-to-back classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a Review Time immediately after your classes (5-30 minutes) whenever possible. Use this time to edit and rework your notes, especially if you're using the 3-column method. For the schedule described above, you might write R: Math. You could also look over any assignments that were given and begin to plan when and how you will do them. Sketch those new assignments into your calendar if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule your Intensive Study Time for each class. Try to schedule some study time each day for each class. Learning is more effectively and efficiently accomplished in shorter, regular sessions than in longer irregular sessions. When you schedule study time, be task-oriented rather than time-oriented. In other words, focused on what needs to get done for your classes (homework, reading, labs, WAMAP, etc.)  Think in terms of "blocks of time" and what specifically needs to be accomplished, not hours of study time. Try to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a Weekly Review (WR) for each course at the end of the week. Look at all of the past week's notes and assignments to see what you have been learning in the past week. Review your goals as well. You can also look ahead to plan the next week and determine how much to adjust your schedule to get it all done.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep open some time for regular Physical Activity. Research shows regular exercise gives you a general sense of well-being, and can reduce tension and help you accomplish a tough class, study, and work schedule. Also, label some empty blocks of time as Open for academic or personal needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule some time during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for Free Time. Play, relax, or do whatever you want to do. This is your reward for sticking to your schedule. In addition, you'll enjoy your free time more.</p></li>
