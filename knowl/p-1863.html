<div class="para">To select a systematic sample, Portland Community College could use their database to select a random student from the first 100 student ID numbers. Then they would select every 100th student ID number after that. Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friendâ€™s because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.</div>
