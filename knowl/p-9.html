<p>Hence, a reasonable, well-thought-out time schedule can make decisions for you, thus desensitizing you to momentary distractions. And, an hour of study in one course is not disturbed by wondering when you will study for another course, or when you'll be able to get out and have some fun, because you've developed a plan, stuck to it, and can feel confident that you're doing what you need to in order to succeed in school.  Create a master schedule (see below) and try to stick to it. It may take time, practice, and persistence. However, you'll most likely be amazed at how efficient you can become and how much time for “fun” stuff you might actually find yourself creating for yourself.</p>
