</h5>Suppose you and your roommates need to move, so you look into renting a moving truck for the day. U-Haul (www.uhaul.com) charges the following amounts for three different trucks. The dimensions for the trucks are given in length x width x height. <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>$19.95 plus $0.79 per mile for a cargo van with inside dimensions: 9'2" x 5'7-1/2" x 4'5"</p></li>
<li><p>$29.95 plus $0.99 per mile for a 14' truck with inside dimensions: 14'6" x 7'8" x 7'2"</p></li>
<li><p>$39.95 plus $0.99 per mile for a 20' truck with inside dimensions: 19'6" x 7'8" x 7'2"</p></li>
</ol> You estimate that you and your roommates have three rooms full of furniture and boxes, equivalent to about 1,000 cubic feet. Your new apartment is about 10 miles (one way) from your old apartment. As a group, decide which vehicle size is a better deal to rent. Provide work to support your answer.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-models-linear.html#exercise-192" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
