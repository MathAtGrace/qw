<div class="para">Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldnâ€™t expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.</div>
