<li><p>Create and maintain a Master Time Schedule. Give it a prominent place (binder cover) where you can see it easily and often. Revise it weekly during your Weekly Review time (see above).</p></li>
<li><p>Put up reminders in your home or office about your goals. Always keep your short and long-term goals in mind. Let them help you prioritize how you use your time.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine and revise your goals on a regular basis. Be sure to record progress towards those goals when you make it.</p></li>
<li><p>Count all your time as time to be used and make every attempt to get satisfaction out of every moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Find something to enjoy in whatever you do.</p></li>
<li><p>Remind yourself, "There is always enough time for the important things." If it is important, you should be able to make time to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Continually look at ways of freeing up your time.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine your old habits and search for ways to change or eliminate them.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to use waiting time¬¬ by review or reworking notes, reviewing flash cards, or doing practice problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep paper or a calendar with you to jot down the things you have to do or notes to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan your day each morning or the night before and set priorities for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain and develop a list of specific things to be done each day, set your priorities and the get the most important ones done as soon in the day as you can. Evaluate your progress at the end of the day briefly.</p></li>
<li><p>Try rewarding yourself when you get things done as you had planned, especially the important ones.</p></li>
<li><p>When you catch yourself procrastinating-ask yourself, "What am I avoiding?" Deal with that head on.</p></li>
<li><p>Concentrate on one thing at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Push yourself and be persistent, especially when you know you are doing well. In the end, you only have you to do this for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure and set deadlines for yourself whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for advice when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to find locations or environments where you can study effectively and therefore use your time efficiently. Experiment with different places to see what works best for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop regretting your failures and start learning from your mistakes. Mistakes are not an indication of personal failure but beginning points of understanding. Take time to reflect on them and think of ways to adopt new study strategies and habits that will avoid and reduce those mistakes over time. (Remember, this is a process!)</p></li>
