<em class="alert">Apportionment</em> is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes. In the United States, there is a certain number of representatives as stated in the constitution, currently 435, and they need to be divided fairly among the 50 states. Since the states are different sizes, and we cannot use fractions of people, this is not an easy task. In addition, the population in each state may change over time. Every 10 years after the census is taken, the representatives are reapportioned.</div>
