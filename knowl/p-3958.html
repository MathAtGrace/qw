<div class="para">Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton’s method, Jefferson’s method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton’s. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest at the time. He would also argue that it’s the ratio of people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that.</div>
