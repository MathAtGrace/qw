<p>Sal, Cal and Val are triplets.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Sal gets a paper route at age 14 and decides to invest $150 each month in a mutual fund which averages a 10% annual return. Sal only makes deposits for 5 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.</p></li>
<li><p>Cal is impressed by Sal's bank account, and gets a job in college at age 19 and dutifully makes deposits of $150 each month into the same mutual fund for 9 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.</p></li>
<li><p>Val partied a lot growing up, but then gets a good job at the age of 27 and diligently makes deposits of $150 each month all the way to retirement at the age of 65.</p></li>
</ul>
