<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Gracie and Lancel are married with no kids, filing jointly.  No one can claim either as a dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>Together, they earned $106,900 of wage income</p></li>
<li><p>They did <em class="emphasis">not</em> earn anything from interest, dividends, distributions, annuities, benefits, capital gains, or anything else.</p></li>
<li><p>They plan to take the standard deduction.</p></li>
<li><p>They contributed more than $600 to their church (According to instructions from the IRS, for a couple filing jointly who take the standard deduction, the maximum amount they can claim is $600).</p></li>
<li><p>They had no qualified business income</p></li>
<li><p>They can claim $2250 in adjustments to income because Gracie is an elementary teacher who can mark $250 for educator expenses and they can claim $2000 because of their payments toward the interest of their student loans.</p></li>
