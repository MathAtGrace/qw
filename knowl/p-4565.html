<div class="para">After citizens cast their votes by mail or on election day on the first Tuesday in November, electors gather in December and are responsible for casting the votes for their state. Electors cannot be elected officials and are chosen by their parties. Electors are expected to vote in alignment with the state they represent, but there have been faithless electors in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that states can penalize electors who do not vote according to the law of the state.</div>
