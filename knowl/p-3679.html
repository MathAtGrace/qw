<p><em class="emphasis">Steps 1-2 are the same as Hamilton and Jefferson</em></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the <em class="alert">divisor</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <em class="alert">quota</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the <em class="alert">initial</em> apportionment. Add up the whole numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 3 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the <em class="alert">modified divisor</em>. This is a trial-and-error process.</p></li>
