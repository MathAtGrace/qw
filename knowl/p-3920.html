<p>Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.</p>
