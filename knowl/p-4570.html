<div class="para">While each state has a set number of electoral votes based on the formula above, the federal government gave states the control of how they distribute and cast their electoral votes (Paiva, 2011). In 48 states, the candidate with the most votes wins all of that state’s electoral votes, often called <em class="alert">winner-takes-all</em>. In essence, a candidate could win with barely a majority of the popular vote in that state and the entire state’s votes goes to that individual (Clayton, 2015). In 2 states, Maine and Nebraska, however, they use a district plan where instead of winner-takes-all, they use <em class="alert">proportionality</em>. This means that they award electoral votes by how individual districts vote. Each district gives their electoral vote to the winner of their district and the remaining two votes go to the candidate that won statewide.</div>
