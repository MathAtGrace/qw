<p>Suppose another mortgage lender offers you a fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.95% APR. You have $20,000 saved as a down payment, and you can afford a maximum mortgage payment of $950 per month. You are interested in a certain house for sale, with firm selling price of $200,000.</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the monthly payment for this house. Can you afford it, under the terms of this lender?</p></li>
<li><p>(Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house?  If so, state the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em> number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.</p></li>
