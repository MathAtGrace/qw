<li><p>After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">= 1000 * (103%) * (103%)</code>. Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.</p></li>
<li><p>Now enter the spreadsheet computation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">= 1000 * (103%)^2</code>. Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)</p></li>
<li><p>(Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)</p></li>
<li><p>(Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?</p></li>
