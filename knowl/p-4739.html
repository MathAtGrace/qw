<div class="para">Next, we will calculate how many votes would be extra over the amount needed to win the election. These are the <em class="alert">surplus votes</em>. In this example, with 7 voters, the majority of a district is 4 votes, so we will subtract 4 from each winning side. From each losing side, all of the votes are considered surplus because they did not go toward electing a candidate of their party. Then we add all the surplus votes for each party.</div>
