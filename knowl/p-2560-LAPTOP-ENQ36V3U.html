<p>All three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score.Â Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.</p>
