<p>After a reapportionment, it is up to each state government to divide their population into equal districts which each elect their representative to the U.S. House. Each representative should represent approximately the same number of people, but their areas may not be the same. Due to different population densities in urban and rural areas, you can see in the map of Oregon that the districts are not geographically equal.</p>
