<li>
<p>Multiply your session-credits by four and your semester-credits by two, and then add these two numbers together.  By session-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of courses that only run for a session (i.e. session A or B)?  By semester-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of classes that run the whole semester.</p>
<p>For example: Your answer should be something like <span class="process-math">\(4 \times (6\text{ credits}) + 2 \times (3\text{ credits}) = 30\text{ hours}\)</span> if you're currently in two session-length courses and one semester-length course.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How many hours per week do you work, on average? How many hours per week do you participate in clubs or sports, on average?  Add these hours together.</p></li>
<li><p>Add together your answers from parts a, b, and c.</p></li>
