<li><div class="para">Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <em class="alert">quota</em>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don’t forget what the decimals were). This is the <em class="alert">initial</em> apportionment. Add up the whole numbers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 3 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the <em class="alert">modified divisor</em>. This is a trial-and-error process.</div></li>
