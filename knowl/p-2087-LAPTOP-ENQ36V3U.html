<p>Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December, 2008<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. At a glance, the two graphs suggest very different stories. The second graph makes it look like more than three times as many people oppose marriage rights as support them. But when we look at the scale we can see that the difference is about 12%. By not starting at zero the difference looks enlarged.</p>
