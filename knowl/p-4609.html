<div class="para">Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes donâ€™t make a very big difference.</div>
