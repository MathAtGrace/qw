<p>A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for $20,000, and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> year later its value has decreased to $17,000.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the value decreased linearly, what was its annual rate of decrease?</p></li>
<li><p>If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the value of your car when it is <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> years old under each assumption, linear or exponential depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the difference between constant slope and constant growth factor.</p></li>
