<p>What is “desensitizing?”  It means reducing the day-to-day and hour-to-hour decisions that you have to make about how to spend your time. Decisions such as whether or not you're going to spend the next hour studying, or whether you will or will not go to the math lab at the library to get work done today, or whether you will or will not go to a movie on impulse, or whether or not to use an hour between classes to get next week's homework assignment out of the way. If you have a plan for how to spend your time, then those decisions are already made for you!</p>
