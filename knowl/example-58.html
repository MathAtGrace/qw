<li><div class="para">Suppose we gather respondents’ ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can’t do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn’t make sense to say that 98036 is "twice" 49018 — that’s like saying that Lynnwood, WA is "twice" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn’t make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, "How would you rate the movie?" with these possible answers:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">It was awful.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It was just okay.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">I liked it.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It was great.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Best movie ever!</div></li>
</ol>
</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-4-2-describing-data.html#example-58" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
