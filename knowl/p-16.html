<p>A university study found that if this number is 60 or higher, you should NOT be surprised if you find yourself having academic difficulties. If you have a total higher than 60, this study found you are much more likely to struggle in school and become overwhelmed. This seems to be a general “magic number” for most students. It does not guarantee anything, but at least gives you an initial realistic idea of whether or not your schedule is manageable. Keep in mind that if you are taking math and/or science, 60 may be too large and you may have to aim for lower hours since math/science courses typically require more time. So, when you register for classes, take this into account. You're better off taking fewer credits now and being successful, as opposed to overloading yourself, failing, and slowing down your progress and momentum.</p>
