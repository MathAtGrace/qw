<p>Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don’t all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let’s look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.</p>
