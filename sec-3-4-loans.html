In this section, you will learn about conventional loans (also called amortized loans or installment loans). Examples include student loans, car loans and home mortgages. These techniques do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front. In this section we will also briefly cover credit cards. There is a more thorough chapter on credit cards available as an optional chapter.</p> </section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-25"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-949">Installment loans are also called <em class="alert">amortized loans</em>. They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the <em class="alert">principal</em> (amount owed) and towards the <em class="alert">interest</em> will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.</p>

<p id="p-950">This is a graph of the interest and principal paid on a loan of $34,000 at 10% APR. Each year $5391.72 was paid in total. In the first year, $3,3305.92 was applied to the interest and $2085.80 was applied to the principal. In the last year of the loan, only $281.04 was applied to the interest and $5,110.68 was applied to the principal. Over 5 years, a total of $53,917.2 was paid for a loan of $34,000.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-26"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-951">In a savings plan, you start with nothing, put money into an account once or on a regular basis, and have a larger balance at the end. Loans work in reverse. You start with a balance owed, make payments and the future value is zero when the loan is paid off.</p>
<p id="p-952">We will continue to use the same spreadsheet formulas. The ones that are most useful for loans are <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=PV</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">=PMT</code>. We will look at how the inputs change for a loan.</p>

<p id="p-1066">With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you will have to pay from the sale.</p>
<p id="p-1067">To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to calculate the payment amount, if we don‚Äôt already know it. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will <em class="emphasis">not</em> have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-1083">Credit cards are useful to many people. They can be used to build a credit score, as a short-term loan and as an alternative to physical cash. It is highly advisable to fully pay off a credit card each month because the interest rates are much higher than the conventional installment loans we discussed earlier. There can also be many expensive fees applied when carrying a balance. Because of these higher rates, it can be very easy to get into a lot of debt quickly.</p>
<p id="p-1084">Credit cards are a common source of loan money, and therefore a common source of debt which must be repaid.  There are much fewer and lower barriers to obtaining and using a credit card than there are to obtaining, for example, a mortgage.  As such, there are some drawbacks both in terms of typically higher interest rates, as well as some structural differences.</p>

Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger.
